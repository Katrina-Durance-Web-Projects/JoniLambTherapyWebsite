# www.jonilambtherapy.com Website

This is my first website development project for a client. Joni Lamb is a therapist starting a new personal practice in Chicago.<br>

This was my first opportunity to build a website from the ground up. The client provided sample websites that she liked and wanted to emulate. She also provided her headshot and all of the text for the various pages. I selected the homepage image and favicon.
