# www.jonilambtherapy.com Website

This was my first website development project for a client and my first opportunity to build a website from the ground up. Joni Lamb is a therapist who started a new personal practice in Chicago.<br>

The client provided sample websites that she liked and wanted to emulate. She also provided her headshot and all of the text for the various pages. I selected the homepage image and favicon and handled the remainder of the design.

This was a great first project because I had great starting material to reference. I designed the entire site for desktop initially because I didn't know about responsive design. As soon as I tested it on my phone I realized I needed to rethink the site. I reached out to a friend who is a web developer and she told me about media queries. I did some research on responsive design and learned more about media queries and incorporated them into my site. I got it to look good on phone and desktop and made the client very happy. Since the client wanted to get away from GoDaddy, where they bought their domain name, I ended up choosing SiteGround as the hosting location.

At the time I only added one media query and I kept it in one CSS file which made it hard to go back to and separate out from the rest of the code. I ended up completely refactoring the CSS for three screen sizes and kept each media query in its own CSS file. This allowed for the site to look much better on tablets and smaller phones. I republished the revised code so the site now shows these updates.

I did testing and debugging using the Chrome and Firefox development tools as well as BrowserStack.
