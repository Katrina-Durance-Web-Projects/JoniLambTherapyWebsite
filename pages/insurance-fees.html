            <strong>I am in-network with BCBSIL PPO.</strong> Please note that I am currently working to become in-network with a handful of other insurance companies. 
            In the meantime, I am an out-of-network provider for all other insurance companies. Upon request, I can provide a superbill directly to clients to submit to their own insurance company for potential reimbursement.

            <strong>Tips for Using Your Health Insurance for Mental Health Care</strong>
            <br>
            Call the member services phone number on the back of your insurance card and ask the following questions to understand your “behavioral health benefits” (or mental health coverage).
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ask to be transferred to the ‘behavioral health department’</strong> as many insurance plans separate physical health and mental health benefits.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>What is my deductible for behavioral health?</strong> A deductible is the amount of money your plan requires you to pay out of pocket for services before your benefits ‘kick in’.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>What is my co-pay or co-insurance?</strong> A co-pay is a flat fee per visit and co-insurance is a percentage of the cost of the total visit. You will pay only your co-pay or co-insurance after you have paid down your deductible.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Do I have a session limit?</strong></li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Do I need a referral from my primary care doctor to see a therapist or psychiatrist?</strong></li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>May I have a list of local ‘in network’ providers emailed to me?</strong> If in network options are not available nearby, most plans offer out of network benefits 
                (typically associated with a higher deductible and higher co-pays or co-insurance).</li>
            </ul>
                <p style="color:red;">* During the Covid-19 crisis, access to in person therapeutic or psychiatric services may be unavailable. Please ask your insurance carrier if "teletherapy":</p>
                <ul class="highlight">
                    <li>is covered and if coverage is temporary</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>is covered at the same benefits as in-person behavioral health</li>
                </ul>
