            <strong>About Me:</strong>
            <br><br>
            Transitions can be overwhelming, anxiety provoking and even lonely. Emerging adults embarking on first careers as well as seasoned adults navigating a new career path or relationship may need help managing their anxiety and stress. People grappling with their own or a loved one’s serious illness may need support from someone outside their immediate support network.
            <br><br>
            I am a social worker with more than a decade of experience providing therapy within community and medical settings. As a medical social worker, I spent years supporting children and young adults diagnosed with cancer or HIV and their families. I use a trauma-informed, anti-racist lens incorporating strengths-based, solution-focused and CBT theories.
            <br><br>
            My areas of specialty include parenting, managing transitions and supporting parents grappling with their aging parent’s significant illness. COVID-19 has especially highlighted these particular stressors for working parents. As your therapist, my goal is to help you manage and navigate these challenging times.
            <br><br>
            Graduated from the University of Illinois at Chicago with a Master’s of Social Work in 2004.
